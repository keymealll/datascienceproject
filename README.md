Project Title: Potential Harms and Cyber Security Regulatory Challenges on Financial Influencers

Abstract
This project explores the challenges and impacts of AI-generated financial influencers on popular social media platforms like YouTube and TikTok. The research will gather comprehensive datasets from these platforms, focusing on metrics such as followers, views, likes, comments, engagement rates, content themes, post frequency, and endorsements of financial products or advice. Utilising Python and relevant analytical tools, the collected data will be cleaned, standardised, and analysed to unveil patterns, trends, and potential adverse effects, such as misinformation and financial risks.

In addition, the project will evaluate the cybersecurity and regulatory implications, ensuring that the findings are aligned with current legal and technological standards. Anticipated outcomes include a deeper insight into the impact of AI-generated financial content, an understanding of potential risks for followers, and recommendations for bolstering cybersecurity regulations.
